## Diabetes Risk Assessment System.
The system is intended to help the user predict diabetes potential risks by keying in relevent user inputs into the trained machine model to predict the risk of falling into class 0 of no diabetes or class 1 of prediabetes or diabetes.
The predictions will then lead users to awareness of possible causes of risks in event of positive return on assessment.
